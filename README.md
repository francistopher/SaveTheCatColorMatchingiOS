# Save The Cat Color Matching iOS!

A repository of the source code of my first [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) App posted on the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) written in vanila [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/) which I had to teach myself and learn from scratch.

## Prologue

After I dropped out of CS, I stayed with my parents for the rest of the year. I was thinking about teaching myself mobile development during that time. I wanted to go to UF but I had too many credits to be considered a 1st year student. I had to get an A.A. degree first, I applied to community college to increase my chances to get into UF. But I missed the deadline to enroll for the Spring 2020 semester at PBSC, either by accident or by purpose, lol.

I previously made a similar game without the cats and the hairballs using [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)). I remebered tasting a genetic test tasting strip when I took AP Biology with Neuberg. I was [choking like a cat who had a hairball lodged in its throat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5wWlMNBrvY) after I tasted the strip.

## Contents :meat_on_bone:

I should've used Folders instead of Groups to organize my code. Don't want to organize it into folders now, it involves to much [sauce and spaghetti](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zPUrgbYFGkM/T4N_PSZjgAI/AAAAAAAAHm4/rgAHlvSmgao/s1600/bacon+spaghetti+with+tomato+cream+sauce.JPG).

## Download

Save The Cat! Color Matching has been removed from the App Store after I realized I would have to pay 100 bucks every year. The web is more flexible. The ipa file has been saved on [this website](https://steprimo.com/iphone/cn/app/1501727048/Save-The-Cat-Color-Matching/). Download it and play for yourself. I don't think game center works since I took it off the App Store.
